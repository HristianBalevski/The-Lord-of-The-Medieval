# The-Lord-of-The-Medieval
The Lord of The Medieval is a game inspired from Heroes 3.
<br/>
<br/>
When I was a teenager I spent many hours playing one medieval game, it's called Heroes of Might and Magic. Today I decided to create something similar to that game. 
<br/>
<br/>**Please check the description down below if you want to play the game.**

At the beginning of the game the system will generate a random hero for you. In the game there are 20 heroes, 10 of them are good, and 10 of them are evil. The good hero will add bonuses to one of your creatures, but the evil hero will make one of your creature's weak. Then you have to choose a number between 1 and 9. The town that you gonna play depends on the number that you choose. After that the game starts.  <br/>
<br/>
1 - Castle <br/>
2 - Rampart <br/>
3 - Tower <br/>
4 - Inferno <br/>
5 - Necropolis <br/>
6 - Dungeon <br/>
7 - Stronghold <br/>
8 - Fortress <br/>
9 - Conflux <br/>

Every time when you have enough mana to do a magic the game will stop, and you have to choose a magic, then the game will continue. You have to think very well how to use your mana, because every mistake costs a lot. The winner is the player who first kills all creatures of the enemy. If you are good strateg you will be the next Lord of The Medieval. <br/> Good Luck! <br/>
<br/>
**All Magics with their numbers in the game:**<br/>
<br/>
1 - Prayer: Increase the attack of the creature with random number from 1 to 10. <br/>
2 - Bless : Increase damage to the creature with 3. <br/>
3 - Shield: Increase defence of the creature with 3. <br/>
4 - Resurrection: Adds to your army from 1 to 30 of the creature that you play at the moment with. <br/>
5 - Haste: Increase the health of the creature with random number from 1 to 10. <br/>
